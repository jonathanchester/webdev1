            <h3>How these futuristic uni's came to be</h3>
            <p>A year prior to the 1999 campaign, the Seattle Mariners set up a one-night promotion based off a simple question: what would Mariners baseball look like in 2027? The idea was enough to turn some heads and the Mariners suddenly had something on thier hands. Thier home staduim, The Kingdome, was given a futuristic feel and thier traditional blue and green color palette was swapped for burgundy, black and white at the behest of Mariners star Ken Griffey Jr.. </p>

            <h3>An ultra-modern idea</h3>
            <p>After a interstellar night that included cooperation by the Kansas City Royals (who also dressed up to 2027 garb), a spaced-themed mascot (Seattle borrowed the Houston Astros' mascot Orbit and dressed him in the future Mariners' colors), and of course a 8-5 Mariners win, the promotion went over as a big success. So much so that the league met with the brain behind it, Seattle's then-marketing director Kevin Martinez, seeking information about how the promotion was put togther with hopes of pitching it to a sponser.</p>

            <h3>The MLB Turns Ahead the Clock</h3>
            <p>The MLB finds a backer for this project in the form of real estate company Century 21, and thus from late June to mid-September, the 20 MLB teams jupmed ahead to the year 2021 (in reference of the company who supported the campaign). The jerseys...well they were a flop. Players thought they look ridiculous; most of them did. Some teams were very involved with the idea, like the New York- rather, the Mercury Mets. Most of the teams that chose not to time-travel to the no-so-distant future were the league's more storied franchises: The Reds, Cubs, Dodgers and Yankees kept it traditional, with the great Yankees owner George Stienbrenner replying to a reporter who asked if he was curious what the 2021 Yanks' uniforms would look like by saying "We're already wearing it." Sure enough, The Boss was right.  </p>

            <h3>The Aftermath</h3>
            <p>Safe to say that these jerseys were not what baseball players in 2021 would be sporting. <i>However,</i> baseball players from 2018 could be seen wearing the jerseys for one night only; specifically the players from the two teams who introduced the promotion. On June 30th, the Mariners and Royals once again donned the "Turn Ahead The Clock" uniforms in honor of the promotion's 20th anniversary. ...A 20th anniversary for a set of retro uniforms meant to look futristic. A paradoxical ending fitting for these sci-fi sports jerseys.</p>
